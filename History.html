<b>1993</b>- HTML 1.0 is released. Not many developers are creating websites at this time.<br>

<strong>1997</strong>- HTML 3.0 was invented. Here, Dave Raggett introduced a fresh draft on HTML, which improved new features of HTML and gave more powerful characteristics for webmasters in designing websites.
Unfortunately, the powerful features slowed down the browser in applying further improvements.

<strong>2014</strong>- HTML 5.0 is released and used worldwide. It is said to be the extended version of HTML 4.01 which was published in 2012.
